# rq [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dflemstr/rq.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dflemstr/rq)

This is the home of the record query tool called `rq`.

The quickest way to install it is:

    curl -sSLf sh.dflemstr.name/rq | sh

It's one of my hack projects for personal learning so the code quality is intentionally pretty low.
